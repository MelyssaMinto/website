I am a grad student in the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics PhD program at Duke University. I hold a B.S. in Biology and a B.S. in Mathematics from Meredith College. I am seeking to expand my computational and theoretical skills, as it relates to understanding the epigenome and gene regulation.

My full CV is avalaible [here](/files/MelyssaMinto_CV.pdf).
